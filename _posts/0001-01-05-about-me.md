<br>Hello! My name is Aubry McConnell, and I was born in the vibrant city of Charleston, South Carolina. Ever since I was young, I have been captivated by the world of computers and technology, constantly exploring and discovering their endless possibilities.

During my high school years, I had the opportunity to take a few programming classes, and it was during this time that my love for coding truly blossomed. I became fascinated by the art of crafting software and the intricate logic behind it.

As my knowledge and experience grew, so did my interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The potential to create intelligent systems that could learn and adapt sparked a fire within me, driving me to pursue a career in this exciting field.

With this determination in mind, I embarked on my journey in college, majoring in computer science. The rigorous coursework and hands-on projects further solidified my skills and deepened my understanding of the ever-evolving world of technology.

Currently, I am living near Clemson University in South Carolina and working at Itron as an R&D firmware tester. This position has allowed me to gain valuable industry experience while honing my technical skills. However, as my passion for machine learning continues to grow, I am eager to transition into a career that aligns more closely with my interests.

I am now actively seeking opportunities that will enable me to build a fulfilling career in the realm of machine learning, and I am excited to embark on new endeavors where I can contribute my skills, passion, and dedication. Join me on this exciting journey as we explore the boundless potential of technology together.
