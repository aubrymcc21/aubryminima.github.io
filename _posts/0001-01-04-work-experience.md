<h2 class="post-title p-name"><span class="white">R&D Firmware Tester at Itron | Aug 2022 - present</span></h2>

At Itron, I have played an integral role in the development, testing, and creation of over a dozen test cases for the Gen 5 Riva electric meters. Specifically, I have focused on Time of Use (TOU) and tamper test cases, ensuring the meters' functionality and accuracy. The tamper test cases I worked on have been crucial in verifying that the meters accurately track instances of covers being removed or replaced, even in challenging scenarios such as power outages.

In addition to my testing responsibilities, I have also made significant contributions to the codebase. I have debugged and expanded a codebase consisting of over 80 thousand lines of code, resulting in improved stability and performance. Utilizing my expertise in various software tools, I have been able to make meaningful enhancements to the firmware, ensuring optimal functionality and reliability.

Skills I honed from this experience:
- C#, ADS, VSC, Microsoft Teams
- This is what I contributed to.
- This is how this will help my future endeavors.

<h2 class="post-title p-name"><span class="white">Summer Intern at CEVAC | May 2022 - Aug 2022</span></h2>

During my summer internship at CEVAC, I had the privilege of leading several teams in the development of a robust database containing over 30 million records. This involved managing and coordinating the efforts of team members, ensuring the timely and accurate collection and storage of data. By implementing efficient database management practices, we were able to streamline the process and maintain data integrity.

One of my notable accomplishments during this internship was creating the backend for the min-max tables. These tables were instrumental in calculating the minimum and maximum temperature readings based on the building number and room type for the Clemson University campus. This data was vital for CEVAC's goal of gathering and analyzing information like occupancy, temperature, and emissions per building. Through the effective utilization of several software tools, I was able to design and implement a scalable solution that met CEVAC's data analysis requirements.

These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a passion for leveraging data to drive meaningful insights and make informed decisions.

Skills I honed from this experience:
- Python, SQL, VSC, Microsoft SQL Server
- This is what I contributed to.
- This is how this will help my future endeavors.


<h2 class="post-title p-name"><span class="white">IT Technical Support at Clemson University | Aug 2019 - May 2022</span></h2>

During my time as an IT Technical Support specialist at Clemson University, I actively contributed to improving work efficiency and streamlining processes. While working on the team, I effectively prioritized and organized incoming support tickets, ensuring that critical issues were addressed promptly and efficiently. This initiative significantly enhanced the overall productivity and responsiveness of the technical support team.

One of my notable achievements was contributing to the development and testing of the Autopilot software to help streamline campus machine imaging. Working on this project not only broadened my understanding of the intricacies involved in machine imaging but also reinforced my commitment to staying up-to-date with emerging technologies.

Through my experiences in IT Technical Support, I have gained a deep appreciation for the synergy between hardware and software components.This experience provided valuable insights into the hardware side of technology, allowing me to expand my knowledge and skills beyond software development. This understanding has fueled my passion for providing seamless and efficient technology solutions that empower users and enhance their experience.

I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and combine it with my passion for innovative technologies to contribute to cutting-edge solutions in this exciting field. With a strong foundation in technical support and software development, I am well-positioned to bridge the gap between user needs and technological advancements.

Skills I honed from this experience:
- This is what I took part in.
- This is what I contributed to.
- This is how this will help my future endeavors.
